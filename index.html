    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™ve been teaching myself to draw since I was a kid; doodling during class, seemingly distracted. Building my
        artistic skill by practicing more and more, I eventually realized that it helped me process my surroundings. I
        am someone who often takes on new challenges and is eager to learn. Just like drawing, there is no skill ceiling
        in tech. I am always approaching new situations with a curious mind and bringing my previous experiences with
        me.</p>
